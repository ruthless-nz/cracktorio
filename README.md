## 1K Science Per Minute
(currently hitting 0.9, needs some adjustemnt with LDS)

## Instructions
(note, also in blueprint)
 
###TO BUILD:  
If you want the train to be connected up first, drop the train loader blueprint.   
Then drop the pre blueprint blueprint, ensuring that the arrows match up.  
Finally, once all the roboports are down, drop the 1k all sciences overtop, again, align the arrow at the bottom.   

This ensures that everything will line up properly, and that the blueprint will build a lot faster.
